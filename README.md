# Hand Gesture Controlled Mouse
 This project implements a real-time hand gesture-based cursor control system using computer vision. It leverages Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks and control the mouse cursor with simple hand gesturesâ€”eliminating the need for traditional input devices like a mouse or trackpad.
