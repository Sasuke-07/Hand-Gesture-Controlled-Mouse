# Hand Gesture Controlled Mouse Movement
 This project implements a real-time hand gesture-based cursor control system using computer vision. It leverages Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks and control the mouse cursor with simple hand gesturesâ€”eliminating the need for traditional input devices like a mouse or trackpad.

 **Features**
Real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition

Cursor movement based on index finger position

Gesture-based click events (e.g., pinching for click)

No external sensors or hardware requiredâ€”only a webcam

Highly responsive and intuitive interaction

Enhances accessibility for differently-abled users
